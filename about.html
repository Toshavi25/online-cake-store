      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Cakwkart means 'Food of the Gods' in Greek, befitting our exclusive and
        indulgent range of offerings that include brownies, cakes, desserts,
        chocolates, breads, and savouries. From our humble beginnings in 2004,
        when the first Cakwkart pastry store opened its doors at the iconic
        Cusrow Baug at Colaba Causeway (Mumbai), we've grown to become a
        Pan-India chain of patisseries with stores in over 30 cities. Our
        mission is to spread happiness by serving smiles on a plate, and this
        journey continues as we open Cakwkart patisseries across the country.
